\chapter{Refactor Categories Tool}
%@<<tool desc>>
%@+node:paran.20140731173741.2006:<<tool desc>>
In order to show that having private views would be useful we created the Refactor Categories Tool. Normally Version Control Systems such a JGit compare and merge files by differentiating between insert, delete and modify operations. 
The Refactor Categories Tool enhances this by also identifying instances where a block of code has moved but the functionality remains unchanged. 
It also can differentiate between changes to comments, white space and Java code. 
This means it can differentiate between instances where a change to a source file does not cause a change in the behaviour of the program and some instances where it has been refactored.

% The test we use with the Refactor Categories Tool analyses all the

% revisions from a Git repository using JGit.
%@-at
%@@c
When the Refactor Categories Tool is run an ordinary text comparison is used as a starting point.
The text comparison within JGit is used with white space ignored.
\label{matchingTextWithAST} The text comparison returns the minimal number of text changes in an \lstinline{EditList} object. 
The \lstinline{EditList} object contains a list of changes to the plain text. Information about each change that the \lstinline{EditList} object retains is:

\begin{itemize}
  \item the starting line of the change for both revisions being compared
  \item The ending line of the change for both revisions 
  \item The type of change that is being made
\end{itemize}

As this is a text comparison the types of changes that are detected between two files are limited to inserts, deletes, and modifications. 
In order to expand this list we need more information.  
We obtain information about the meaning of Java files by parsing both of the revisions we are comparing.  
We use JastAddJ \cite{Oqvist2013} to parse the information into an AST. 
Once we have the AST we need to discover which AST nodes match which changes to the text in the source code.

\label{sec:over} 
Both the \lstinline{EditList} object and  AST nodes contain information about the line of source the AST node starts and ends at.  
Unlike the \lstinline{EditList} object an AST node can also hold the column that the AST node starts and ends at.  
Using this positional information we can match the text changes in the \lstinline{EditList} object to a set of AST nodes.

There are likely to be AST nodes that are not included in any of the change sets and can be safely ignored.
In order to find those AST nodes we are interested in we need to traverse the AST.
The root node spans the entire file. 
By examining the children of the root however, we can determine which children contain all or part of the matching text change.

\begin{figure}[!t]
 \begin{center}
  \includegraphics[scale=1]{drilldown1}
 \end{center}
 \caption{An AST showing each AST Node arranged in a tree and with Child 3 consisting of a text change.  Each AST Node and text change has a start row recorded before the node and an end row recorded after the node.}
 \label{fig:findingASTNode}
\end{figure}

An example of this can be found in Figure \ref{fig:findingASTNode}.  In this Figure it is safe to ignore any children of the AST node marked 'Child 1' because 'Child 1' does not contain the text change.  The AST Node marked 'Child 3' however is interesting as its location places it within a text change. 


\begin{figure}[!t]
 \begin{center}
  \includegraphics[scale=1]{DrilldownEx}
 \end{center}
 \caption{An AST showing a partial overlap between child 1 and a text change, and child 2 and a text change.}
 \label{fig:troubleASTNode}
\end{figure}

Another interesting question is how the tool deals with situations where a text change partly overlaps an AST node or an AST node only partly covers a text item.  
In Figure \ref{fig:troubleASTNode} two different AST nodes each contain part of a text change. 
By examining any possible children of `Child 1' and `Child 2' we could discover 4 types of AST Nodes:
\begin{description}

  \item [AST nodes that are not included in the text change.]
    Any AST node that cannot be associated with a text change can be safely ignored. 
    It means that there are no changes to the text and therefore no changes to that AST Node.
  \item [AST nodes that are fully encapsulated by the text change.] 
    These are the AST nodes that we wanted to discover as they are entirely within the range of a text change.
    It means that this AST node has changed and warrants further investigation. 
    There may also be text changes that are outside the AST node.
    If they are not part of any AST node they would be classified as comments or white-space. 
  \item [AST nodes that partly include the text change but have child AST nodes.]
    If an AST node has children and it is not fully contained by the text change we recursively check the children.
  \item [AST nodes that partly include the text change but have no child AST Nodes.]
    If an AST node is a leaf node in an AST and it contains a text change then it is highly likely that the AST node has changed.
    As there has been changes to this AST node then it also warrants further investigation. 
    Any part of the text change that is not part of the AST node and not part of any other AST node would be classified as comments or white-space.    
\end{description}

In both Figure \ref{fig:findingASTNode} and Figure \ref{fig:troubleASTNode} there are portions of text that are outside an AST node.  These are of interest to us because these are instances where the text may have been changed but it has no impact on the behaviour of the program.  The most likely instances of this is when a comment has changed or if white space has been introduced in the middle of source code.

%@<<move>>
%@+node:paran.20140823073953.2206:<<move>>
If an AST Node has been inserted at one point and a similar one deleted it is possible to see if a code block has moved.  
The following shows an example of original source code before any methods have been moved: 

\begin{lstlisting}
%@<<base Move>>
%@+node:paran.20140813185646.2167:<<base Move>>
public class SampleMoveAndChange {
  double rect(double w, double h) {return w * h;}
  double tri(double b, double h) {return b / 2 * h;}
  double cube(double len) { return 6 * sqr(len);}
  double circ(double rad) { return Math.PI * sqr(rad);}
  double sqr(double num) {return num * num;}
}
%@nonl
%@-node:paran.20140813185646.2167:<<base Move>>
%@nl
\end{lstlisting}

Once we move the \lstinline{tri} method to before the \lstinline{rect} method and \lstinline{circ} method to after the \lstinline{sqr} method the code now looks like this:

\begin{lstlisting}
%@<<modified Move>>
%@+node:paran.20140813185646.2168:<<modified Move>>
public class SampleMoveAndChange {
  double tri(double b, double h) {return b / 2 * h;}
  double rect(double w, double h) {return w * h;}
  double cube(double len) {return 6 * sqr(len);}
  double sqr(double num) {return num * num;}
  double circ(double rad) {return sqr(rad) * Math.PI;}
}

%@nl
\end{lstlisting}

\caption{A comparison of similar code with methods that have moved and changed}
 \label{fig:modscreenshot}
\end{figure}


A comparison of the source code using Meld, a graphical merge tool is shown in Figure ~\ref{fig:modscreenshot}.
Both \lstinline{rect} and \lstinline{circ} have been deleted from the original version and have been inserted into the modified version.  
However the \lstinline{circ} method has also changed slightly. 
When this code is compared and parsed into an AST we will initially have four differences due to both the deletion and insertion of the two methods.    
We are not able to directly compare the deleted AST nodes with the inserted AST Node to see if they are equal because the \lstinline{circ} method has been changed slightly. 
Instead of checking for equality we need to check for similarity.
By comparing all the AST nodes for a delete candidate against all the AST nodes for a insert candidate we are able to calculate a score that shows how similar they are.

%@<<multiple inserts>>
%@+node:paran.20140823073953.2205:<<multiple inserts>>
There could be more than one insert and we need to compare them against all the deletes to obtain the scores for each combination.
In the above example for instance we need to compare the deletion of \lstinline{circ} with both the insertion of \lstinline{rect} and the modified \lstinline{circ} to determine which one is the better fit.

%@<<move within container>>
%@+node:paran.20140823073953.2203:<<move within container>>
If a method is moved from one class into an inner class the programs' behaviour could have changed. 
When this occurs there is no guarantee that a match between that insert and delete is a valid one.
If a method has been shifted within the same class however, the program will still act the same.  
Therefore in order to determine if the move is one that has no impact the matches are only counted if a match can be found within the same container.  
Here, a container is an enclosing scope within the source code, such as a class. 
Restricting any valid moves to a container ensures we get moves that don't change the behaviour of the program.

%@+at
% 
% Another change we are interested in is if items have been moved.  We would 
% notice this if there is a both insert and a delete for similar AST node 
% types within the same scope.  If a method has been shifted within a class we 
% would notice similar AST nodes, one being deleted at one location, the other 
% being inserted at a different location.  This is another example of a text 
% change that does not change the behaviour of the program.

%@<<calculate scores>>
%@+node:paran.20140823073953.2204:<<calculate scores>>
To calculate the scores for a single change we start at the root AST node for both the insert and delete candidates.  
If the root nodes have the same type and fields then we can then check their children. 
By performing a diff between the lists of children for both the insert and delete candidates we obtain the minimum number of differences.  
If an extra child AST node has been inserted or a child AST node is deleted then 1 is added to the score. 
If a child AST node has been modified it is the equivalent of both a child AST node being inserted and one being deleted so 2 is added to the score. 
If there has been no change to a child AST node we need to recursively assign a score using its children. 
To get the total percentage of children that changed we divide the score against the total number of children for both the delete and insert AST nodes we are scoring.

In the example in Figure ~\ref{fig:matchComp} two AST nodes are being compared with each other. The red AST node has been deleted and an orange AST node have been inserted. Because the yellow node has been modified it has effectively been deleted and a green node has been inserted. This means there have been a total of four changes to this level of the AST. 

\begin{figure}[!t]
 \begin{center}
 \includegraphics[scale=1]{matchComp}
 \end{center}
 \caption{Two AST nodes being compared to each other by comparing the differences in their child nodes.}
 \label{fig:matchComp}
\end{figure}

Scores are stored in a two dimensional array where the rows are insert candidates and the columns are delete candidates.  
We use the greedy algorithm to select the lowest score in the array.  
Insert and delete candidates that are selected are recorded as a move and should not be compared with anything else. 
The comparisons that are no longer possible are in the same column or row in the array.  
The comparisons that are no longer possible are removed and the next lowest score for a match is evaluated.  
To ensure that anything cannot be matched with anything once all good matches are eliminated a limit is set ensuring that any further matches are ignored.  
The two items that could have otherwise been matched will remain a solitary insert and a delete.

\subsection{Detects renaming}
%@<<detecting renames>>
%@+node:paran.20140606104644.2009:<<detecting renames>>
The Refactor Categories Tool can also detects some renaming. 
It does this by comparing the names for each each node.
If the name has changed but the node type and all the children nodes are still the same then it places the change into the `rename' category.
When the Refactor Categories Tool does not check every AST node it can not determine if the rename operation is going to have impact on other code.
This means that if all copies of a methods or variable have not been uniformly renamed it cannot find the ones that remain unchanged.

%@<<detecting equ>>
%@+node:paran.20140823073953.2207:<<detecting equ>>
In some situations when the code has been modified the ASTs still remain the same.

\subsection{Detects changes to comments} 
%@<<detecting comments>>
%@+node:paran.20140606104644.2011:<<detecting comments>>
In addition to doing a comparison of AST Nodes the Refactor Categories tool also detects text changes that are located between AST nodes.
These changes could be comments or white space and are checked to see if they have been inserted, deleted, modified or moved.
The Refactor Categories Tool first does a cursory examination of the text differences between two files.
It then examines both the differences in executable Java code and the differences between comments and white-space. 

%@<<moving Text>>
%@+node:paran.20140816070821.2184:<<moving Text>>
This detection of comments and white-space also extends to move operations 
As it is possible for the comment to change we also need to test for similarity rather than equality.  
This is done by comparing the characters in the code block that has been deleted with characters from the code block that has been inserted.  
A comparison is done between the two code blocks using a diff to obtain the smallest number of changes. 
A score of 1 is added for each deleted or inserted character.
If a character has been modified a score of 2 is added. 
To obtain the percentage of items changed the score is divided by the total number of characters in both code blocks.

%@+node:paran.20140805175513.2166:<<Performance>>
Performance is an issue especially for when examining large software projects that have many changes. This means we have not only had to look at using more memory for the Refactor Categories Tool but also had to make some changes to the code to free up more memory where required.

\begin{description}
 \item [By setting object references back to null when they are no longer used.]
  %@  <<setting to null>>
  %@+node:paran.20140806072550.2155:<<setting to null>>
  Once a difference has been detected we attempt to remove any of the information we are not going to use in the future.  This should help the garbage collector free up memory. We do this by setting the AST nodes recorded against a difference to null once the difference has been discovered.

  By ignoring AST nodes and any of their child nodes that do not have a text based change comparing all the AST nodes can be avoided.  This will also help to speed up analysis as these nodes do not need to be analysed to see if they match.

  If we were not testing for moves in the same scope we would need to test every deleted AST node against every inserted AST node for the entire file. By stipulating that we can only be sure if it is a legal move if it is in the same scope we not only eliminate a lot of relocations of source code that are illegal but also reduce the number of items that need to be compared. In addition to this the AST node along with its type are recorded in a hash map.  This ensures that only AST nodes that are a similar type are compared against each other.

Java was chosen as both the language to write the tool in and to be the language that the tool would recognise.  This was done as it was a language we understood and to make use of JDime if it was going to be part of the tool.  
We wanted to use Git due to its distributed nature.  
The reasons for choosing a distributed version control system was that we wanted each private view being able to function on its own as a fully fledged project without being dependant on a server.  As we were already using Java rather than using the main Git distribution which is written in C we needed to use JGit instead.

We could not use JDime because of the issues discussed earlier. Instead we used JastAddJ --- the same Java implementation that JDime uses so that we could implement some of the differences we required including being comment aware and only examining each of the copies of source code.

%@<<compares changes>>
%@+node:paran.20140801074838.2011:<<compares changes>>
There are a number of design differences between JDime and the Refactor Categories Tool.
 Instead of doing a text comparison first and only proceeding to analyse the program using an AST if there are conflicts the Refactor Categories Tool examines all entries that have a difference in them.
Although this takes longer and is more memory intensive there is an advantage to this.  
If a merge was done using an ordinary text comparison and there is a non functional change to only one revision there is no conflict and JDime only does a text based merge.  
During this text based merge we could get the non functional changes that change the source code without changing the programs' behaviour. By examining all changes irrespective of if the text has conflicts means that the Refactor Categories Tool can determine if it is a change that would not affect the behaviour of a program.

As there is a cost overhead with testing all the changes rather than just the conflicting ones the Refactor Categories Tool needs to be efficient in how it tests changes.  Assuming that changes occur in select areas in the file there are portions of the file that have not been changed.  
As mentioned in Section \ref{sec:over} we use positional information to match AST Nodes to text changes.  By ignoring portions of the AST that do not have any text changes we avoid spending extra time where we know changes have not occurred.

% This means that  a smaller amount time in the portions that have already

% when we analyse the AST tree.  The information used is the ranges of line 
% numbers and operations identified by the histogram merge. The change set has

% out which AST items these changes affect. This is done by loading the file 
% into the JastAddJ parser to get an AST tree. Line numbers for each item in

% numbers are matched to the position information stored in each AST node 
% using the following method.
% 
% The root of the AST is identified as the AST node we need to start at.
% We only begin any analysis, if the AST node resides completely within a 
% block of text changes.

%@+node:paran.20140801202652.2011:<<resolving gaps>>
In some instances there is no position information stored in the JastAddJ AST nodes.  This could be because they are generated by the parser to reflect parts of the Java language that are inferred rather than directly mentioned in the code.  An example of this would be the use of super in the constructor.  Even if it is not written in the code for every constructor has a super. Likewise all methods mentioned in an interface have a public type even if is not in the code.

To get around this problem we needed to discover the end position of the previous AST Node to determine the position the inferred AST node should occupy.  This means that the inferred AST node is in the right position but is not represented by a block of text in the source code.

Comment and white-space are also examined separately as they also could give some indication of where code has been moved from or to.
Before being checked to find matches unnecessary white-space is identified and recorded.
Any text that remains is examined to determine if its is a comment. 

Because of the way we are using the position in the code to identify AST nodes there are circumstances when parts of the Java programming language are identified as being surplus text. These have already been identified and represented as an AST Node. By identifying comments we can eliminate any of the items falsely recorded as comments.

Rather than comparing everything with each other to determine matches it is more efficient to match just the items that are under the same AST structure.  This means that it is more likely that we get a match that is going to be relevant and valid.  An example of this is matching methods. If the methods are under the same container (a class) they may be legally swapped without causing issues.  If the method has been moved to an inner class from an outer one however it becomes more complicated and we cannot guarantee that the code is equivalent.

% not experienced a text based change we cannot guarantee that a rename 
% operation is a valid one. We have an indication that it might be if the code 
% still compiles without error. If a variable name is changed to that of an 
% already existing variable however the behaviour of the program could change. 
% This is known as a \emph{semantic conflict}.  This issue already exists in a 
% text based merge and Fan \cite{Fan2012}, Shao \cite{Shao2009} and others 
% address this issue.
