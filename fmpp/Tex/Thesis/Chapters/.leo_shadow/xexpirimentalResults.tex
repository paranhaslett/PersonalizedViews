%@+node:paran.20140813185646.2164:<<purpose>>
The purpose of this experiment is to measure how many insertions, deletion and modifications are performed on the Java AST verses comments across a range of realistic bemchmarks. Similarly, how many insert and delete pairs can be classified as moves.

% establish if there are superficial changes in currently working projects.  
% By superficial we mean that the change does not add much of value apart from 
% personal taste or formatting.  In some cases changes to the order of methods 
% within a class does change the behaviour of a program, this is an example of 
% a superficial change.  It is harder to determine if comments are superficial 
% because certain comments could be important to others and others irrelevant. 
% We will attempt to establish if there are any patterns in comments to 
% determine if they are superficial or not.  Determining if there are 
% superficial change may indicate that there is a separation between personal 
% preferences that would be best contained in a private view and items that 
% need to be shared for collaboration.

We will now outline the experimental methodology. Our goal is make it possible for someone to reproduce our experiment.

%@<<setup>>
%@+node:paran.20140813185646.2166:<<setup>>
The experiment was run on a Lenovo laptop with 3.5GB Ram and 113.2 GB disk space assigned to the 64 bit Ubuntu 13.10 (Saucy Salamander) operating system. The tests were written in Java and run within the Eclipse IDE

The Refactor Categories Tool analyses all the historical changes ever made on a software project by extracting successive revisions from a Git repository using JGit.  Once we have two revisions we need to compare them.  To do this we compare each of the Java files in both revisons one by one. We only test the Java file if it has been modified or renamed.  If the file been inserted or deleted we ignore it beacuse there is no way to make a comparison. Once we have established that Java files exist, both in the original and the updated copy, we use the text diff in JGit to compare them. As outlined in section \ref{matchingTextWithAST} we figure out which AST nodes the text changes contain. 

The Refactor Categories Tool splits up the identified blocks of souce code into several AST nodes and identifies anything between AST Nodes as being text. 
This text is further evaluated to determine if it is a change to comments or a change to white space. 
An example of this is if the text comparison detects a single change that inserts two new methods and a comment.  
The Refactor Categories Tool will recognise this as three distinct changes. 
This means that it is possible for the Refactor Categories Tool to notice more changes than a text based comparison. 

We had some garbage collection memory issues with some benchmarks that we were testing. 
To resolve these issues` the Refactor Categories Tool was run individiually once for each benchmark to further ensure that there were no memory leaks between runs.
We also increased the memory by changing the parameters for the run configuration.  The following parameters were added to the run configuration for the test.

\begin{verbatim}
-Xms512M 
-Xmx4096M

After running the Refactor Categories tool over our benchmark suite we obtained the results shown in Table \ref{tab:results}

\end{table}

The number of text changes that were recognised during text comparison for each benchmark are shown in Table \ref{tab:textcomp}. Note that the values in this table are lower as the Refactor Categories tool detects multiple changes which a text based comparision agregates.

% There are a number of Java categories that the Refactor Categories Tool will 
% recognise.  Apart from the traditional insert, delete and modify it will 
% aslo recogise if an Ast Node has been renamed but the content and type of 
% the node remains the same.  It will recognise valid moves within a scope. It 
% will also recognise when the text based merge got it wrong by claiming that 
% the code was not fuctionally equivalent when in fact it was.
% 
% Apart from this it will also diferentiate between Java code and comments.  
% It can tell if comments have been inserted, modified, moved or deleted.  It 
% will also pick up any changes to that whitespace that have not already been 
% figured out by the text based comparison.
