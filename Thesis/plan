do some additional tests
  see what happens with incorrect java
  initialisation order
  remove Array and see how quickly it can run over the others 

Jgit already compiles but eclipse complains (we cannot use git attributes)

need to figure out where to make the cahnges in git

look at the code see if there is a way top preserve original structure for the mergee
retain code equivilencies for text that appears to be different
  (may be better to retain points where the code differs, or both?)
  add new comparison into JDime (code already deemed equivilent) 
    include where in the tree it is no longer equivilent 

figure out how to recognise where in the code the differneces take place 
    

what we could do 

associate conflicting lines with conflicting code
trim the AST tree for non conflicting lines
adjust Jdime to print structure in left order
if there is no Text or AST conflict for simply output the same text
if there is a text conflict and no ast cononflict what do we do conflict? prefer left? prefer right?


use the jgit line merger isnstead of the diff tool associated with rcs?
insert Jdime instead of the merge tool 

what capability do we have for jaSTADDj TO RETAIN LINE NO
