\title{Maintaining differently refactored views in Java}
\author{Paran Haslett}

\subject{Computer Science}
\abstract{
When developers collaborate on a project there are times when the code diverges. This could be due to refactoring or the code being reused in another project. It could even be due to throw away code or code used for debugging. This could at times also involve how the structure of the program is presented or the variable and method names that are being used. This is especially true if there is a piece of functionality that you wish to work on that differs from what everyone else is working on. In these cases you may need to refactor the code to best suit your changes before you apply them. The ability to have a separate view which although functionally equivalent to other views can present the code in a different form in these situations would be valuable. It enables the programmer to refactor or change the code with minimal impact on others. If the relationships between views are maintained it also could better recognise the changes that need to be communicated to other views or branches.
