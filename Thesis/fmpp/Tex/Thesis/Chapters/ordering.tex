\chapter{Unordered Text}

The work by apel and Lessnich caters for when the text is unordered

It only does this in event of their being a conflict in the a text merge.   They cite the merge taking to long if they incorporated each change.
if it detects an unorderdd section it does not preserve the order of the output.  As this is an ivestigation into how to preserve different views the order of the view being merged into needs to be preserved.  Any additions or removals from the instigator of the merge need to be sorted into the order dictated by the view being merged into.
