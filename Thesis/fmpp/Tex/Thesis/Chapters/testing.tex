\chapter{Testing}
In order to test this we must first replicate the work of Apel and Le{\ss}nich

\section{Setting up the enviornment}
The work of Apel and Les{\ss}nich has mostly been done in Java.  There are a few exceptions including the liniar programming libraries that need to be created.  As We are attempting to combine some of their work with Git it was decided to use JGit rather than the C implementation of Git. As the java implimentation may run a bit slower then in order to get a good timing test running we need to run redo the tests of Jdime using Jgit instead.
