% 
% removing the AST nodes once they have been used
% 
% future work: by keeping track of equivalencies there is no need to retest 
% using the AST
% 
% future work: performance could be further enhanced by only parsing nodes that 
% are part of the change set or are ancestors of this.  This however would 
% require major changes to the parser or rewriting it. It would save memory in 
% addition to speeding up the parsing of Java code into AST nodes.
