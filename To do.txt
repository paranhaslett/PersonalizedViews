Can we do 3pm?  I'd like to get away about 4pm.

Just glancing over the latest version, I can see that you've fixed quite a
few things (I didn't keep a copy so I can't check them all).  I did notice
a few things that haven't been fixed:

p4, still no thesis outline.

p24, "Figure 2.4.2" twice - one of which is part of a passage that should
be deleted.

p27, give URL for Semantic Merge.

p37, replace "prove" by "show" or "demonstrate" or something else more
appropriate.

BTW: on p30, you say "As proven by [6]".  This should also be "shown" or
something similar, not "proven".

p41, "programs'" -> "program's"
missing figure reference

Looking at Chapters 5 & 6:

p49, Chapter 5 needs to start with a more general statement about what you
did and what the chapter is about.  For examples, something like "To
evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we performed an experiment to
measure the performance of the Refactor Classifying Tool on a range of Java
programs."

p49, you need to refer to the table on p50 in the text, explaining what
programs were used in the experiement.

How were the different versions obtained?

p51, "issues'" should not have an apostrophe

p52, line -5.  "warrent" -> "warrant"

p52, line -1.  "suete" -> "suite

Section 5.3.2.  You need to say more than this about your results.  Refer
to some specific results and explain what they mean.

The last paragraph doesn't belong here - it should go with the discussion
of what you did.

I was expecting you to compare the results obtained with your tool with
that obtained using a tool such as jDIME.  Would that have ben more
illuminating?

Also a couple of sentences with no full stops at the end.

Chapter 6 still needs some conclusions, specifically a summary of what you
have done and of your experimental results - that should come before the
discussion of future work.

That's all for now!

Cheers
